# 🚂 Master-Slave Controlling System for Locomotive Application using RF

**Project Duration:** Oct 2024 – Jan 2025  
**Supervisor:** Prof. Ambresh

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a wireless communication-based master-slave control system for locomotive applications. Using RF modules and microcontrollers, the system enables remote control of locomotive functions with real-time feedback. The control logic is developed in Embedded C, and a Java-based desktop UI is designed for monitoring and control.

## ⚙️ System Workflow

1. Master controller sends control commands wirelessly via RF module.  
2. Slave controller receives commands and performs locomotive control actions.  
3. Slave sends real-time status feedback to master unit.  
4. Java-based desktop UI receives and displays status, enabling user interaction.  
5. Continuous monitoring ensures safe and efficient locomotive operation.
